# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI to Docker Hub

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    #branches: [ master ]
    tags:
      - "v*.*.*"
      # To fire this workflow, first switch to the branch then use the following 
      # commands to trigger on a tag instead of branch, in this example we are on
      # branch 6.4.54-16067-1:
      # git tag -a v6.4.54
      # git push origin v6.4.54

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
